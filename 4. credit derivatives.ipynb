A trade is an uptick (downtick) if the price is higher (lower) than the price of the previous trade. When the price is the same, it's a zero tick. If the tick before the zero tick is an uptick (downtick), then the trade is a zero-uptick (zero-downtick). A trade is classified as a \"buy\" if it occurs on an uptick or a zero-uptick, otherwise it's a \"sell\".\n",

    "The tick-test can classify all trades in the trade data without additional information. However, certain irregular trades can be mislabeled. For instance, trades that are recorded out of sequence or include special conditions attached (such as a pre-agreed, non-market price) cannot be labeled. Fortunately, such irregular trades are only a minority among the regular trades.\n",
